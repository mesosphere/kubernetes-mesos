package version

// Base version information.
//
// This is the fallback data used when version information from git is not
// provided via go ldflags. It provides an approximation of the Kubernetes
// version for ad-hoc builds (e.g. `go build`) that cannot get the version
// information from git.
//
// The "-dev" suffix in the version info indicates that fact, and it means the
// current build is from a version greater that version. For example, v0.7-dev
// means version > 0.7 and < 0.8. (There's exceptions to this rule, see
// docs/releasing.md for more details.)
//
// When releasing a new Kubernetes version, this file should be updated to
// reflect the new version, and then a git annotated tag (using format vX.Y
// where X == Major version and Y == Minor version) should be created to point
// to the commit that updates pkg/version/base.go
